- [ ] Fine tune swedish Transcriber Whisper - https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper
  - [ ] Feature engineering pipeline, upload to Hopsworks
  - [ ] Model training pipeline
    - [ ] Save checkpoints of progress to huggingface
    - [ ] Upload the final result to huggingface
    - [ ] Runs in google colab
  - Training data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0/viewer/sv-SE/train
- [ ] Create huggingface ui
- [ ] write Readme
  - [ ] How can performance be improved using model-centric approach - e.g., tune hyperparameters, change the fine-tuning model architecture, etc
  - [ ] How can performance be improved using data-centric approach - identify new data sources that enable you to train a better model that one provided in the blog post

Deliver:
- Deliver your description for task 2 as a README.md file in the **root of your Github repository**
- Deliver a Hugging Face Spaces public URL for the UI for your speech transcription model.
